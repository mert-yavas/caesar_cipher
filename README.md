# Caesar Cipher

## Overview

Hello! I'm Mert, and on Day 8 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge, I'm excited to present my implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher. This Python version allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using one of the oldest known encryption techniques.

## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is both simple and effective:

1. You choose whether to encrypt ('encode') or decrypt ('decode') a message.
2. Enter the message you want to encode or decode.
3. Specify a shift number, which determines how many letters each character in your message will be shifted.
4. The script then processes each letter of your message, shifting it by the specified number in the alphabet.
5. Non-alphabetical characters are left unchanged for readability.
6. The final encrypted or decrypted message is displayed.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption:** Choose to either encrypt your messages for privacy or decrypt them to reveal the original text.
- **Customizable Shift:** Control the degree of your cipher with a custom shift number.
- **Alphabet Preservation:** Maintains the integrity of the alphabet, wrapping around if the shift extends beyond 'z' or 'a'.
- **Special Characters Untouched:** Non-letter characters are not altered, maintaining the readability of your message.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple input prompts and clear instructions make the program easy to use.

## Try It Out

Have fun encrypting and decrypting messages with the Caesar Cipher! Test out different shift values and see how your messages transform. It's a great way to learn about historical encryption methods while enjoying a bit of coding. Enjoy experimenting with this timeless cipher technique!
